	<br>An oil filter is a filter designed to remove contaminants from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil. Their chief use is in internal-combustion engines for motor vehicles (both on- and off-road ), powered aircraft, railway locomotives, ships and boats, and static engines such as generators and pumps. Other vehicle hydraulic systems are often equiped with an oil filter. oil filters are made by different companies</p>

	<p class="box color2"><span class="sub-heading color22">AIR FILTER</span>
	<br> A particulate air filter is a device composed of fibrous, or porous materials which removes solid particulates such as dust, pollen, mold, and bacteria from the air. Filters containing an adsorbent or catalyst such as charcoal (carbon) may also remove odors and gaseous pollutants such as volatile organic compounds or ozone. Air filters are used in applications where air quality is important, notably in building ventilation systems, in engines.</p>

	<p class="box color3"><span class="sub-heading color33">ENGINE OIL</span>
	<br> Motor oil protects the engines moving parts from coming in contact with each other. Cleaning Motor oil cleans the engine of debris. As the oil is pumped throughout the engine, the oil collects debris as it travels. The debris is then collected inside of the oil and dispensed into the oil filter of the car. This process keeps the engine clean from debris and material that accumulates from normal use.</p>
